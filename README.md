# Some Washed Teams

A school project for the organization YRGO.

### About
This project, titled Some Washed Teams, is a school assignment showcasing the fundamental concepts of web development using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the     application of loops and variable usage within an interactive HTML website. By leveraging these essential programming constructs, the project highlights how data can be dynamically manipulated and       presented to users, enhancing the user experience and interactivity of web applications.

### Features
  
- The data being used is in data.php.
  
- There is an index.php file which uses the other php files to function.

- The header.php file contains a html head section which links to a .css file.

- The file teamcount.php echos the total number of teams in the data.

- The file table.php prints out all the data into a nice html table.

- There is usage of the mapbox API in the index file in which it helps to show where all the teams are located.
